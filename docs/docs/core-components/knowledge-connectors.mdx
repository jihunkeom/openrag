<!--
Proposed plan to reorganize the knowledge content again:

About knowledge (repurpose /knowledge page)
What is knowledge
The role of OpenSearch
The index (only 1, possibly soon easier to rename)
Auth modes (maybe use a partial)
See also: Other knowledge pages

Configure knowledge (new page)
Knowledge ingestion settings (reorg/cleanup)
See also: Configure connectors

Ingest knowledge (existing page)
Connector setup will be moved to a different page.
See also: Configure connectors, browse and manage knowledge
TBD: Supported file types

Browse and manage knowledge (new page)
Browse knowledge
Inspect
Search
Default docs
Delete
See also: Local doc path setting, filter knowledge, ingest knowledge

Filter knowledge (existing page)

Configure connectors (new page)
Oauth mode (maybe use a partial, maybe change the /knowledge#auth links to point here)
Cloud storage connector setup
TBD: disconnector/reconnect connectors, better separation of Oauth providers vs cloud storage access
See also: About knowledge, ingest knowledge
Related tasks: Check all links to the 3 existing pages, check all anchors and sections without dedicated anchors, check nav titles in sidebar.js.
